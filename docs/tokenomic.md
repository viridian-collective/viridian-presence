Invent a token-based mechanism

valide the theories underlying the Paid Open Source model.

Clarify the vision of programmable money as a Digital Public Good: a transparent and inclusive economy that powers Open Source software and other DPG's. 
Develop context for the need to discriminate fairly as a problem in governance. 
Use Universal Basic Income as a corner concept and imagine what the world with UBI powered by programmable money. 
Connect to key metrics for blockchain ecosystems and estimate the parameters dependend on requirements for UBI: eg. number of people and monthly allowance. 
Promote Principled negotiation as framework to apply to the problem of fair discrimination. 
Highlight importance of the problem in designing programmable money following the principles in Sustainable Development Goals.  
Support with the re-imagining contributor agreements as tokens. Token ownership defines membership in the set of contributors, which creates a clear boundary between UBI powered by the treasury and a model that supports Paid Open Source.

The problem then can be reframed into the need to describe transparent criteria to be programmed into the minting script, token burning and blacklisting, vesting or staking. 

review of existing models:
radicle:
- user recieves token A
- user vests token A and meets oracle criteria to recieve token B

githoney:
- developer proposes feature
- project accepts feature

andamio:
- a contract validates the set of conditions that makes a person eligible to mint a Contributor token.- the Contributor token is vested into a task.
- the user browses Project's task board to pick a task and vest their Contributor token into the task.- task completion is validated with the process agreed upon through a governance process.
