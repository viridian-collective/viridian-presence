a community token to reward sharing git repos on p2p.

## Milestone 1: environment set up and experimentation.
aimed at creating Open Source economy around Intersect MBO. The initial pitch is to create software that rewards sharing git repositories on p2p. To do so we envisioned integrating cardano-node and radicle, a program that enables sharing git repos on p2p. Our first milestone is an mvp demonstrating core functions of the system.
