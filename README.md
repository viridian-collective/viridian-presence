The Viridian Presence project is dedicated to realizing the vision of Cardano as the programmable money to empower Open Source initiatives. Our mission is to cultivate a thriving ecosystem that harnesses Cardano's cutting-edge blockchain technology, fostering the growth and development of open-source projects, and ultimately contributing to Cardano's recognition as a Digital Public Good.

**Rationale: Lottery as a Model of UBI on Cardano**
----------------------------------------------

Developing a lottery as a model of Universal Basic Income (UBI) on Cardano helps ideate and develop the vision of Cardano as programmable money to power Open Source in several ways:

1. **Demonstrating Programmable Money**: By creating a lottery on Cardano, we demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of the platform as a programmable money. This showcases the potential for Cardano to support a wide range of financial applications, including those that promote social welfare and community development.
2. **Fostering Governance Conversations**: The development of a lottery as a UBI model encourages conversations around governance, fairness, and transparency. This helps to establish a framework for decision-making and resource allocation, which is essential for the growth and sustainability of Open Source initiatives.
3. **Empowering Open Source Ecosystems**: By providing a UBI model, we can empower Open Source developers and contributors, fostering a thriving ecosystem that is not reliant on traditional funding models. This aligns with the values of Open Source and promotes the development of innovative, community-driven projects.
4. **Promoting Financial Inclusion**: A lottery-based UBI on Cardano can help promote financial inclusion, particularly in underserved communities. By providing a basic income guarantee, we can help ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to participate in the digital economy.
